        <summary>curse (noun, verb) /kɜrs/ LISTEN A woman cursing at other drivers A curse is something that is said to cause someone misfortune or, figuratively, something that causes pain and trouble. It also means ‘swearword.’ As a verb, to curse means both ‘to wish misfortune upon someone or something’ or ‘to say one or more swearwords.’ In addition, it means ‘to complain about something, possibly using swearwords.’ Example sentences The witch put a curse on the whole village and they had nothing but bad luck after that. This year, my grandma got sick, my mom lost her job, our house flooded, and then our dog died; it&#039;s like there&#039;s a curse on us! Raphaël hit his thumb with the hammer and let out a stream of curses. The witch cursed the young prince, and he turned into a frog. The young man was clearly very angry and was cursing at everybody. When Alison lost her job, she cursed the day she ever met her boss. Words often used with curse be cursed with: suffer from. Example: “She was cursed with two left feet and couldn’t dance at all!” be cursed to: have to do something because of a curse. Example: “The princess was cursed to sleep for one hundred years.” In pop culture Watch a clip from the claymation (clay animation) movie Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit here: Additional information If you say “John cursed” or “John cursed at someone,” it means that John is using swearwords; curse in this sense is an exact synonym of the verb swear. However, in the expression “John cursed somebody (or something),” then John is specifically wishing that person or thing ill or complaining about them; if John has magical powers, it can also mean that John put a curse on them. Did you know? Menstruation is colloquially known as “the curse.” This is sometimes assumed to be because God cursed Eve with menstruation for eating the forbidden fruit, but actually God cursed Eve with pain in childbirth. However, religions have often created taboos around menstruation, so there may be a connection. There are many other euphemisms to refer to menstruation, such as Aunt Flo (normally in the phrases “Aunt Flo is in town” or “Aunt Flo is visiting”) or somebody might say she “has the painters and decorators in.” These euphemisms are sometimes considered old fashioned, and many women just say “I have my period” (period is another word for the menstrual cycle). Other forms curser (noun) Origin Curse dates back to before the year 1050, in the form of the Old and Middle English noun curs. Its origin is uncertain. There are no related Germanic, Romance or Celtic words. In late Old English, curs meant ‘a prayer that evil or harm should come to someone,’ so some linguists think curse may have come from the Latin cursus (course), which was the name given to the ‘set of daily liturgical prayers,’ and used in the ‘sentence of the great curse,’ which was the formula read in churches to excommunicate offenders four times a year. Other linguists have proposed a relation to the Old French curuz (anger), but there is scant evidence for it, and some have also suggested a link to the word cross, but this is considered highly unlikely. The senses ‘evil invoked upon someone’ and ‘something that causes severe trouble’ both appeared in the 14th century. Curses (always in plural), has been used as a histrionic exclamation wince the mid-17th century, and the sense of curse as a swearword evolved from this use. The curse, as the sentence imposed on Adam and Eve in the Bible, was first recorded in the 19th century, and the curse as a euphemism for menstruation has been used since the 1930s. The verb also dates back to before the year 1050, in the form of the Old English cursian and later the Middle English cursen. It came from the same (unknown) source as the noun.

        <summary>nag (verb, noun) /næg/ LISTEN Teenagers often think their parents are nagging them. Nag is a word used informally among native speakers. It means ‘to annoy by constant demands or criticism,’ or ‘to be the cause of pain, irritation, or unease.’ Even more informally, a nag is a person who nags and irritates other people all the time. Example sentences Every summer my husband nags me about putting on sunblock; he&#039;s right of course, because I burn easily and I always forget! Henry went to see the doctor about a pain that had been nagging him for some time. The painter was always nagged by doubts about how good her work was. My boss is such a nag and never just leaves us alone to get on with the job. Words often used with nag You can also use nag without a direct object, in which case it takes the preposition “at.” Example: “The idea that she had left the oven on kept nagging at Frances.” Nag is also used without an object and with the adverb “on” to mean that someone keeps nagging. Example: “Teenagers often complain that their parents are always nagging on about how much TV they watch.” In pop culture Listen to Joan Jett and the Blackhearts singing “Nag” here: Additional information A nag is also a horse, usually an old horse that someone considers worthless. Did you know? When talking about a person nagging or being a nag, the word used to mainly be associated with women. However, in these less sexist times, most people recognize that both men and women can nag a lot! Other forms nagger (noun) Origin Nag, meaning ‘to annoy by scolding,’ is a relatively new term, and dates back to the early 19th century. Its origin is uncertain, but it is thought to have evolved from a dialectal term, nag, that meant ‘to gnaw,’ and probably came from a Scandinavian source. As such, it can be traced back to the Proto-Germanic gnagan (to gnaw). Nag is related to the Old Norse gnaga (‘to complain,’ but literally ‘to bite or gnaw’) and the dialectal Swedish and Norwegian nagga (to gnaw), as well as the Old Saxon gnagan, the Old Norse and Swedish gnaga, the Middle Dutch and Dutch knagen, the Old High German gnagan and the German nagen (all meaning ‘to gnaw’), and of course the English word gnaw. The noun meaning ‘a person who nags’ dates back to the mid-19th century, and comes from the verb. Nag, meaning ‘a riding pony’ and ‘an old horse,’ dates back to around the year 1400, in the form of the Middle English noun nagge. Its origin is uncertain, but it is thought to be related to the word neigh, of imitative origin.

        <summary>blend (verb, noun) /blɛnd/ LISTEN A woman using a blender To blend means ‘to mix two or more things smoothly‘ or ‘to combine in a really nice way.’ It also means ‘to have no separation that can be easily seen.’ As a noun, you might have heard the word blend in wines or teas; this is because blend means ‘a mixture produced by blending.’ Example sentences Leave the soup to simmer for fifteen minutes and then blend it until smooth.

Words like this are also called portmanteau words. Did you know? A blender is a common kitchen appliance. It is the tall, motorized machine that you can use to make juice, smoothies, milkshakes, etc. There is also a similar appliance called a stick blender, or immersion blender, which has a similar effect but is much smaller and can be held in the hand and immersed, or put, into the thing you are blending. Other forms blender (noun) Origin Blend, meaning ‘to mix something until the parts become indistinguishable’ or ‘to stir a liquid,’ dates back to around the year 1300, in the form of the Middle English verb blenden. Its origin is uncertain. Some linguists think that it evolved from the Old English blendan or blondan (to mix), while others think it came into English from the (related) Old Norse blanda (to mix). It’s possible that it evolved as a combination of both. Either way, blend can be traced back to the Proto-Germanic blandan (‘to mix,’ literally ‘to make cloudy’) and the Proto-Indo-European root bhel– (to shine, flash or burn), and is related to the Old Saxon and Old High German blantan (to mix), the Middle Dutch blanden (to mix), the Gothic blandan (to mix), the Old Church Slavonic blesti (to go astray), the German Blendling (bastard or mongrel) and the Danish blande (to mix), as well as the Sanskrit bhrajate (shines), the Greek phlegein (to burn), the Latin flamma (flame), fulmen (lightning) and fulgere (to shine or flash), the Lithuanian balnas (pale) and blandus (troubled, stupid or thick), and English words such as black, blanch, blanket, blaze, bleach, bleak, blind, blond, blue, blushflagrant, flame and flamingo. The figurative sense, ‘to mingle closely,’ first appeared in the early 14th century. The noun, meaning ‘a mixture formed by blending,’ comes from the verb, and dates back to the mid-19th century.

        <summary>rocket (noun, verb) /ˈrɑkɪt/ LISTEN A rocket is any tube-like device that contains fuel, which burns and makes it fly through the air; it can be used for fireworks, signaling, etc. A rocket is also a space capsule put into orbit. As a verb, it means ‘to transport with a rocket,’ ‘to move very rapidly,’ and, informally, ‘to increase suddenly.’ Rocket has another completely different meaning; as a noun, it is a Mediterranean plant used in green leaf salads, although it is more commonly known as arugula in US English. Example sentences The fireworks display organizers saved a big rocket for the finale. The policeman sent up a rocket as a warning. Crowds of people gathered to see the rocket launch into space. The spaceship was rocketed into orbit. The car rocketed along the highway. Prices have rocketed since last year. Harry added some rocket leaves to his sandwich. Words often used with rocket it’s not rocket science: an expression meaning that something is not really very complicated. Example: “Haven’t you finished doing your homework yet? Come on; it’s not rocket science!” A similar expression with the same meaning is “It’s not brain surgery.” give someone a rocket (UK): reprimand someone severely, get very mad at someone. Example: “The boss gave Joe a rocket when he arrived 30 minutes late for an important meeting.” In pop culture Someone who works on rockets, like a scientist or engineer, is called a rocketeer. The Rocketeer is the title of a 1991 movie and you can see the trailer for it here: Did you know? In English we also have the related word skyrocket. This word can refer to a kind of rocket, but (perhaps more commonly) it is an informal verb meaning ‘to increase a lot’ or ‘to increase astronomically.’ Example: “The cost of US colleges has skyrocketed since my parents were kids.” Skyrocket is the opposite of plummet, one of our first Words of the Day. Other forms rocketlike (adjective) Origin Rocket, meaning ‘a self-propelling device,’ dates back to the early 17th century. It came into English from the Italian rochetto (a bobbin), the diminutive of rocca (a distaff, which is a device used for spinning thread). It is thought to have come into Italian from a Germanic source, and can be traced back to the Proto-Germanic rukkon– and the Proto-Indo-European root rug– (fabric or spun yarn). Rocket is, therefore, related to the Old High German rocko, the Old Norse rokkr, the German Rocken, the Swedish rock and the Icelandic rokkur (all meaning ‘a distaff’). The sense ‘a fuel-propelled device,’ first used for fireworks, dates back to the early 20th century. The verb, which originally meant ‘to attack with rockets,’ dates back to the late 18th century, and comes from the noun. The sense ‘to spring like a rocket’ was first used in the mid-19th century. Rocket, the noun meaning ‘a leafy green plant used in salads,’ is a bit older; it dates back to around the year 1500. It came into English from the Middle French noun roquette, which was in turn borrowed from the Italian rochetta, diminutive for ruca (a type of cabbage). It can be traced back to the Latin eruca (colewort), which is related to ericus (‘hedgehog’ or ‘beam with spikes’) and the Proto-Indo-European root ghers– (to bristle). Rocket, in this sense, is related to the Sanskrit harsate (bristles), the Avestan zarshayamna– (ruffling your feathers) and the Welsh garw (rough), as well as the English arugula and many other modern terms for the plant, and the English word horror.

        <summary>knack (noun) /næk/ LISTEN Sylvia has a knack for math. Knack is a word used informally to mean ‘a skill or ability’ and it can also mean ‘a clever way of doing something.’ Knack also means ‘a particular talent for doing something’ or ‘a tendency to do something.’ Example sentences Sylvia has a real knack with children; they adore her. The washing machine does work, but you have to press the button a certain way; there&#039;s a knack to it. Alicia has a knack for computer programming and works for a tech company in San Francisco. Melanie has a knack of picking the wrong boyfriends; they always end up breaking her heart. In pop culture Listen to the Knack’s “My Sharona” here: Don&#039;t confuse it with The term knackered sounds similar but means something completely different. It is very common in the UK, especially in informal conversation, and means ‘extremely tired.’ For example, “I was knackered last night and slept for 12 hours.” It is not very common in the US, where we would just say “really tired” or something similar. Did you know? Knack can be used with either “for” or “of” when talking about a talent or tendency. Some dictionaries say that “knack of” should be used with a behavior or tendency (ie, “a knack of picking the wrong boyfriends”) and “knack for” should be used for a skill (ie, “a knack for computer programming”), but many native speakers don’t know about this rule. Origin Knack, which originally meant ‘a deception, trick or device,’ dates back to the mid-14th century. Its origin is uncertain, but some linguists think it may have come from another, slightly older (early 14th century) Middle English word, knak or knakke, which meant ‘a sharp-sounding blow or sound,’ which probably came into English from a Germanic language, and was originally imitative. Knack is possibly related to the German knacken (to crack), and the English words knap (a sharp-sounding blow) and crack. The sense ‘a special ability for something’ was first used in the late 16th century, though some linguists actually think knack in this sense could have been a separate word, also of unknown origin.
