        <summary>foil (verb, noun) /fɔɪl/ LISTEN A person fencing, using a foil Foil is a roll of extremely thin sheet metal used mainly to wrap food. It is also a person or a thing that serves as a contrast and makes another person or thing look better. As a verb, to foil means ‘to frustrate and prevent the success of a plan.’ A foil is also a flexible sword used in the sport fencing. Example sentences Jamie wrapped the leftovers in foil and put them in the fridge. In famous comic duos, there is usually a &quot;straight man&quot; and a comedian. The straight man does not tell jokes and is a foil for the comedian. Their plans for a picnic were foiled by bad weather. The two women took up their foils and began to fence. Words often used with foil The food wrap is more fully known as aluminum foil in the US and aluminium foil in the UK. Especially in the UK, people also sometimes call it tinfoil. In pop culture Watch comedian and singer-songwriter Weird Al Yankovic performing his song “Foil,” in praise of the stuff used for wrapping food, here: Additional information As a verb, foil can also mean ‘to apply foil’ or ‘to cover something in foil.’ Did you know? Fencing has been practiced for centuries, mostly as a way men learned how to duel (ie, fight between two people with weapons) and defend themselves. Some believe that, at the end of the Roman Empire, German soldiers spread the practice of resolving arguments by dueling, so learning how to fight with a sword became essential. In some places, dueling was prohibited in the 15th century, but the tradition of fencing continued. It began to be seen as a sport in the 18th century, and it has been an Olympic sport since the first modern Olympic Games were held, in 1896.   Origin The verb foil, originally meaning ‘to spoil a trace or scent by running over it,’ dates back to around the year 1300, as the Middle English verb foilen (another related verb, defoilen, actually meant the same thing and was more common). It came into English from the Old French foler or fuler (‘to trample on, injure or maim,’ and figuratively, ‘to treat badly, deceive or get the better of someone’), and can be traced back to the Vulgar Latin fullāre (to clean cloth by treading on it) and the Latin fullo (a person who cleans cloth), though its origin before then is uncertain. The sense expanded to the more general ‘to overthrow or defeat’ and ‘to frustrate the efforts of someone’ in the mid-16th century. The noun foil, meaning ‘a very thin sheet of metal,’ dates back to the early 14th century, as the Middle English foile. It came into English from the Old French foil, fueill or fueille (leaf, foliage, sheet or paper or sheet of metal), and can be traced back to the Latin folia, the plural of folium (leaf) and the Proto-Indo-European root bhel– (to thrive or bloom). Foil is related to the French fueille, the Italian foglia, the Portuguese folha and the Spanish hoja (all meaning ‘leaf’ or ‘sheet of paper or metal’), as well as the Greek phyllon (leaf), the Latin flos (flower) and derived Romance language terms like the Spanish flor and the French fleur, the Middle Irish blath and Welsh blawd (blossom or flower), the Gaelic bile (leaflet or blossom), and English words such as blade, bleed, bless, blow, blood, bloom, blossom, exfoliate, floral, flour, flower and portfolio. The sense ‘person or thing that makes another look better by contrast’ appeared in the late 16th century, and is a figurative use of the practice of backing a gem with foil to make it shine brighter. The sense ‘metallic food wrap’ was first used in the late 19th century. The verb foil, meaning ‘to apply foil,’ dates back to the early 17th century and comes from the noun. Foil, meaning ‘a light sword used in fencing,’ dates back to the late 16th century. Linguists actually disagree on whether it comes from the noun sense (a thin sheet of metal) or from the verb (to frustrate or prevent success).

Slum is used figuratively to talk about any place where living conditions are unpleasant or dirty. Slum can also be used like an adjective, to describe something related to a slum or someone who lives in one. Example sentences Many poor people live in the slums and can&#039;t afford to move to a different neighborhood. You should see her house; it&#039;s an absolute slum!

Other forms slummer (noun) Origin Slum dates back to the early 19th century, and was a slang word that originally meant ‘room,’ particularly ‘back room.’ The sense we use today appeared in the mid-19th century, as a shortened form of the expression back slum (early 19th century), which originally meant ‘dirty back alley in a city’ as well as ‘city of poor people.’ Its use was spread by crime novels set in the East End of London, which were very popular at the time. The verb, meaning ‘to visit slums for disreputable purposes,’ dates back to the mid-19th century. The sense shifted to mean ‘to visit the slums of a city (for entertainment),’ probably also due to popular crime novels, in the late 19th century.

It is also a judge’s seat and it is used figuratively as a symbol of a judge’s power. In sports, it is the seat where the team members who are not playing sit. As a verb, in US English, to bench somebody means ‘to remove somebody from a sports game,’ but it is also used informally to mean ‘to remove someone from any other situation.’ Example sentences The three girls sat on the bench in the park to eat their lunch. The judge entered the courtroom and sat on the bench. That lady used to be a judge; she served on the bench for 30 years. The substitutes were waiting on the bench, hoping they would get a chance to play. The coach had to bench the midfielder after he committed three consecutive fouls. The manager benched half of the sales team when he heard they&#039;d been telling lies about the competition. Words often used with bench bench press: This is an exercise where someone lies on a bench and pushes a weight (called a barbell) up and down with their arms; this can also be a verb for the action of pushing the weight up and down. Colloquially, the verb can be shortened to just bench. Example: “I can bench 215 pounds.” workbench: a sturdy (ie, extremely stable) table where an artisan works. Example: “The potter painted the vase at her workbench.” In pop culture If a member of a sports team is usually on the bench, you can humorously refer to them as a benchwarmer (because they are keeping the bench warm). The Benchwarmers is the title of a 2006 movie, and you can watch the trailer for it here: Additional information Bench also means ‘to exhibit a dog at a dog show,’ because the platform where the animals are placed during the show is also called a bench. Example: “The trainer plans to bench his toy poodle at several dog shows this year.” Informally, in sports, bench can refer not just to the actual bench where the substitute players sit, but also the players themselves. Example: “The team is successful because they have a deep bench.” Did you know? The long seats where politicians sit in the British Houses of Parliament are called benches. Senior politicians or spokespeople for their parties sit on the front bench (they are known as frontbenchers) and less senior members sit farther back, on the back benches (they are known as backbenchers). Frontbench and backbench are also used as adjectives to describe actions undertaken by the people who sit on the front or back benches. Example: “This frontbench policy has met with a lot of backbench opposition.” Origin Bench dates back to before the year 1000, in the form of the Old English noun benc (Middle English benk, bynk or bench), which meant ‘long seat’ (especially one without a back). It can be traced back to the Proto-Germanic bankiz (bench) and the Proto-Indo-European root b(h)ewg(h)– (to bend or curve). Bench is related to the Old Frisian bank, the Old Norse bekkr, the Danish bænk, the Middle Dutch banc, the Old High German banch, the Dutch bank, the German Bank, the Danish bænk, the Swedish bänk, the Icelandic bekkur and the Scots benk or bink (all meaning ‘bench’), as well as the English word bank (in the sense of a natural incline on the shore of a body of water). Bench has been used to refer to the place where judges sit since around the year 1300, and this sense extended to ‘the office of a judge’ and to ‘judges collectively’ in the 14th century. The sports sense was first used in the US in the late 19th century to refer to the physical place where players sat during a game, and extended to ‘the players not in the game’ in the early 20th century. The verb dates back to the mid-19th century, and comes from the noun. It originally meant ‘to display a dog in a dog show,’ though that sense is no longer in use. The current meaning, ‘to take a player out of a game,’ was first used in the US in the early 20th century.

        <summary>curse (noun, verb) /kɜrs/ LISTEN A woman cursing at other drivers A curse is something that is said to cause someone misfortune or, figuratively, something that causes pain and trouble. It also means ‘swearword.’ As a verb, to curse means both ‘to wish misfortune upon someone or something’ or ‘to say one or more swearwords.’ In addition, it means ‘to complain about something, possibly using swearwords.’ Example sentences The witch put a curse on the whole village and they had nothing but bad luck after that. This year, my grandma got sick, my mom lost her job, our house flooded, and then our dog died; it&#039;s like there&#039;s a curse on us! Raphaël hit his thumb with the hammer and let out a stream of curses. The witch cursed the young prince, and he turned into a frog. The young man was clearly very angry and was cursing at everybody. When Alison lost her job, she cursed the day she ever met her boss. Words often used with curse be cursed with: suffer from. Example: “She was cursed with two left feet and couldn’t dance at all!” be cursed to: have to do something because of a curse. Example: “The princess was cursed to sleep for one hundred years.” In pop culture Watch a clip from the claymation (clay animation) movie Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit here: Additional information If you say “John cursed” or “John cursed at someone,” it means that John is using swearwords; curse in this sense is an exact synonym of the verb swear. However, in the expression “John cursed somebody (or something),” then John is specifically wishing that person or thing ill or complaining about them; if John has magical powers, it can also mean that John put a curse on them. Did you know? Menstruation is colloquially known as “the curse.” This is sometimes assumed to be because God cursed Eve with menstruation for eating the forbidden fruit, but actually God cursed Eve with pain in childbirth. However, religions have often created taboos around menstruation, so there may be a connection. There are many other euphemisms to refer to menstruation, such as Aunt Flo (normally in the phrases “Aunt Flo is in town” or “Aunt Flo is visiting”) or somebody might say she “has the painters and decorators in.” These euphemisms are sometimes considered old fashioned, and many women just say “I have my period” (period is another word for the menstrual cycle). Other forms curser (noun) Origin Curse dates back to before the year 1050, in the form of the Old and Middle English noun curs. Its origin is uncertain. There are no related Germanic, Romance or Celtic words. In late Old English, curs meant ‘a prayer that evil or harm should come to someone,’ so some linguists think curse may have come from the Latin cursus (course), which was the name given to the ‘set of daily liturgical prayers,’ and used in the ‘sentence of the great curse,’ which was the formula read in churches to excommunicate offenders four times a year. Other linguists have proposed a relation to the Old French curuz (anger), but there is scant evidence for it, and some have also suggested a link to the word cross, but this is considered highly unlikely. The senses ‘evil invoked upon someone’ and ‘something that causes severe trouble’ both appeared in the 14th century. Curses (always in plural), has been used as a histrionic exclamation wince the mid-17th century, and the sense of curse as a swearword evolved from this use. The curse, as the sentence imposed on Adam and Eve in the Bible, was first recorded in the 19th century, and the curse as a euphemism for menstruation has been used since the 1930s. The verb also dates back to before the year 1050, in the form of the Old English cursian and later the Middle English cursen. It came from the same (unknown) source as the noun.

        <summary>nag (verb, noun) /næg/ LISTEN Teenagers often think their parents are nagging them. Nag is a word used informally among native speakers. It means ‘to annoy by constant demands or criticism,’ or ‘to be the cause of pain, irritation, or unease.’ Even more informally, a nag is a person who nags and irritates other people all the time. Example sentences Every summer my husband nags me about putting on sunblock; he&#039;s right of course, because I burn easily and I always forget! Henry went to see the doctor about a pain that had been nagging him for some time. The painter was always nagged by doubts about how good her work was.

Words often used with nag You can also use nag without a direct object, in which case it takes the preposition “at.” Example: “The idea that she had left the oven on kept nagging at Frances.” Nag is also used without an object and with the adverb “on” to mean that someone keeps nagging. Example: “Teenagers often complain that their parents are always nagging on about how much TV they watch.” In pop culture Listen to Joan Jett and the Blackhearts singing “Nag” here: Additional information A nag is also a horse, usually an old horse that someone considers worthless.

However, in these less sexist times, most people recognize that both men and women can nag a lot! Other forms nagger (noun) Origin Nag, meaning ‘to annoy by scolding,’ is a relatively new term, and dates back to the early 19th century. Its origin is uncertain, but it is thought to have evolved from a dialectal term, nag, that meant ‘to gnaw,’ and probably came from a Scandinavian source. As such, it can be traced back to the Proto-Germanic gnagan (to gnaw). Nag is related to the Old Norse gnaga (‘to complain,’ but literally ‘to bite or gnaw’) and the dialectal Swedish and Norwegian nagga (to gnaw), as well as the Old Saxon gnagan, the Old Norse and Swedish gnaga, the Middle Dutch and Dutch knagen, the Old High German gnagan and the German nagen (all meaning ‘to gnaw’), and of course the English word gnaw. The noun meaning ‘a person who nags’ dates back to the mid-19th century, and comes from the verb. Nag, meaning ‘a riding pony’ and ‘an old horse,’ dates back to around the year 1400, in the form of the Middle English noun nagge. Its origin is uncertain, but it is thought to be related to the word neigh, of imitative origin.
