        <summary>bench (noun, verb) /bɛntʃ/ LISTEN A bench is a long seat for three or four people, often found in parks and public spaces. It is also a judge’s seat and it is used figuratively as a symbol of a judge’s power. In sports, it is the seat where the team members who are not playing sit. As a verb, in US English, to bench somebody means ‘to remove somebody from a sports game,’ but it is also used informally to mean ‘to remove someone from any other situation.’ Example sentences The three girls sat on the bench in the park to eat their lunch. The judge entered the courtroom and sat on the bench. That lady used to be a judge; she served on the bench for 30 years. The substitutes were waiting on the bench, hoping they would get a chance to play. The coach had to bench the midfielder after he committed three consecutive fouls. The manager benched half of the sales team when he heard they&#039;d been telling lies about the competition. Words often used with bench bench press: This is an exercise where someone lies on a bench and pushes a weight (called a barbell) up and down with their arms; this can also be a verb for the action of pushing the weight up and down. Colloquially, the verb can be shortened to just bench. Example: “I can bench 215 pounds.” workbench: a sturdy (ie, extremely stable) table where an artisan works. Example: “The potter painted the vase at her workbench.” In pop culture If a member of a sports team is usually on the bench, you can humorously refer to them as a benchwarmer (because they are keeping the bench warm). The Benchwarmers is the title of a 2006 movie, and you can watch the trailer for it here: Additional information Bench also means ‘to exhibit a dog at a dog show,’ because the platform where the animals are placed during the show is also called a bench. Example: “The trainer plans to bench his toy poodle at several dog shows this year.” Informally, in sports, bench can refer not just to the actual bench where the substitute players sit, but also the players themselves. Example: “The team is successful because they have a deep bench.” Did you know? The long seats where politicians sit in the British Houses of Parliament are called benches. Senior politicians or spokespeople for their parties sit on the front bench (they are known as frontbenchers) and less senior members sit farther back, on the back benches (they are known as backbenchers). Frontbench and backbench are also used as adjectives to describe actions undertaken by the people who sit on the front or back benches. Example: “This frontbench policy has met with a lot of backbench opposition.” Origin Bench dates back to before the year 1000, in the form of the Old English noun benc (Middle English benk, bynk or bench), which meant ‘long seat’ (especially one without a back). It can be traced back to the Proto-Germanic bankiz (bench) and the Proto-Indo-European root b(h)ewg(h)– (to bend or curve). Bench is related to the Old Frisian bank, the Old Norse bekkr, the Danish bænk, the Middle Dutch banc, the Old High German banch, the Dutch bank, the German Bank, the Danish bænk, the Swedish bänk, the Icelandic bekkur and the Scots benk or bink (all meaning ‘bench’), as well as the English word bank (in the sense of a natural incline on the shore of a body of water). Bench has been used to refer to the place where judges sit since around the year 1300, and this sense extended to ‘the office of a judge’ and to ‘judges collectively’ in the 14th century. The sports sense was first used in the US in the late 19th century to refer to the physical place where players sat during a game, and extended to ‘the players not in the game’ in the early 20th century. The verb dates back to the mid-19th century, and comes from the noun. It originally meant ‘to display a dog in a dog show,’ though that sense is no longer in use. The current meaning, ‘to take a player out of a game,’ was first used in the US in the early 20th century.

        <summary>curse (noun, verb) /kɜrs/ LISTEN A woman cursing at other drivers A curse is something that is said to cause someone misfortune or, figuratively, something that causes pain and trouble. It also means ‘swearword.’ As a verb, to curse means both ‘to wish misfortune upon someone or something’ or ‘to say one or more swearwords.’ In addition, it means ‘to complain about something, possibly using swearwords.’ Example sentences The witch put a curse on the whole village and they had nothing but bad luck after that. This year, my grandma got sick, my mom lost her job, our house flooded, and then our dog died; it&#039;s like there&#039;s a curse on us! Raphaël hit his thumb with the hammer and let out a stream of curses. The witch cursed the young prince, and he turned into a frog. The young man was clearly very angry and was cursing at everybody. When Alison lost her job, she cursed the day she ever met her boss. Words often used with curse be cursed with: suffer from. Example: “She was cursed with two left feet and couldn’t dance at all!” be cursed to: have to do something because of a curse. Example: “The princess was cursed to sleep for one hundred years.” In pop culture Watch a clip from the claymation (clay animation) movie Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit here: Additional information If you say “John cursed” or “John cursed at someone,” it means that John is using swearwords; curse in this sense is an exact synonym of the verb swear. However, in the expression “John cursed somebody (or something),” then John is specifically wishing that person or thing ill or complaining about them; if John has magical powers, it can also mean that John put a curse on them. Did you know? Menstruation is colloquially known as “the curse.” This is sometimes assumed to be because God cursed Eve with menstruation for eating the forbidden fruit, but actually God cursed Eve with pain in childbirth. However, religions have often created taboos around menstruation, so there may be a connection. There are many other euphemisms to refer to menstruation, such as Aunt Flo (normally in the phrases “Aunt Flo is in town” or “Aunt Flo is visiting”) or somebody might say she “has the painters and decorators in.” These euphemisms are sometimes considered old fashioned, and many women just say “I have my period” (period is another word for the menstrual cycle). Other forms curser (noun) Origin Curse dates back to before the year 1050, in the form of the Old and Middle English noun curs. Its origin is uncertain. There are no related Germanic, Romance or Celtic words. In late Old English, curs meant ‘a prayer that evil or harm should come to someone,’ so some linguists think curse may have come from the Latin cursus (course), which was the name given to the ‘set of daily liturgical prayers,’ and used in the ‘sentence of the great curse,’ which was the formula read in churches to excommunicate offenders four times a year. Other linguists have proposed a relation to the Old French curuz (anger), but there is scant evidence for it, and some have also suggested a link to the word cross, but this is considered highly unlikely. The senses ‘evil invoked upon someone’ and ‘something that causes severe trouble’ both appeared in the 14th century. Curses (always in plural), has been used as a histrionic exclamation wince the mid-17th century, and the sense of curse as a swearword evolved from this use. The curse, as the sentence imposed on Adam and Eve in the Bible, was first recorded in the 19th century, and the curse as a euphemism for menstruation has been used since the 1930s. The verb also dates back to before the year 1050, in the form of the Old English cursian and later the Middle English cursen. It came from the same (unknown) source as the noun.

Its origin is uncertain, but it is thought to have evolved from a dialectal term, nag, that meant ‘to gnaw,’ and probably came from a Scandinavian source. As such, it can be traced back to the Proto-Germanic gnagan (to gnaw). Nag is related to the Old Norse gnaga (‘to complain,’ but literally ‘to bite or gnaw’) and the dialectal Swedish and Norwegian nagga (to gnaw), as well as the Old Saxon gnagan, the Old Norse and Swedish gnaga, the Middle Dutch and Dutch knagen, the Old High German gnagan and the German nagen (all meaning ‘to gnaw’), and of course the English word gnaw.

It’s possible that it evolved as a combination of both. Either way, blend can be traced back to the Proto-Germanic blandan (‘to mix,’ literally ‘to make cloudy’) and the Proto-Indo-European root bhel– (to shine, flash or burn), and is related to the Old Saxon and Old High German blantan (to mix), the Middle Dutch blanden (to mix), the Gothic blandan (to mix), the Old Church Slavonic blesti (to go astray), the German Blendling (bastard or mongrel) and the Danish blande (to mix), as well as the Sanskrit bhrajate (shines), the Greek phlegein (to burn), the Latin flamma (flame), fulmen (lightning) and fulgere (to shine or flash), the Lithuanian balnas (pale) and blandus (troubled, stupid or thick), and English words such as black, blanch, blanket, blaze, bleach, bleak, blind, blond, blue, blushflagrant, flame and flamingo.

        <summary>rocket (noun, verb) /ˈrɑkɪt/ LISTEN A rocket is any tube-like device that contains fuel, which burns and makes it fly through the air; it can be used for fireworks, signaling, etc. A rocket is also a space capsule put into orbit. As a verb, it means ‘to transport with a rocket,’ ‘to move very rapidly,’ and, informally, ‘to increase suddenly.’ Rocket has another completely different meaning; as a noun, it is a Mediterranean plant used in green leaf salads, although it is more commonly known as arugula in US English. Example sentences The fireworks display organizers saved a big rocket for the finale. The policeman sent up a rocket as a warning. Crowds of people gathered to see the rocket launch into space.

The Rocketeer is the title of a 1991 movie and you can see the trailer for it here: Did you know? In English we also have the related word skyrocket. This word can refer to a kind of rocket, but (perhaps more commonly) it is an informal verb meaning ‘to increase a lot’ or ‘to increase astronomically.’ Example: “The cost of US colleges has skyrocketed since my parents were kids.” Skyrocket is the opposite of plummet, one of our first Words of the Day. Other forms rocketlike (adjective) Origin Rocket, meaning ‘a self-propelling device,’ dates back to the early 17th century. It came into English from the Italian rochetto (a bobbin), the diminutive of rocca (a distaff, which is a device used for spinning thread). It is thought to have come into Italian from a Germanic source, and can be traced back to the Proto-Germanic rukkon– and the Proto-Indo-European root rug– (fabric or spun yarn). Rocket is, therefore, related to the Old High German rocko, the Old Norse rokkr, the German Rocken, the Swedish rock and the Icelandic rokkur (all meaning ‘a distaff’). The sense ‘a fuel-propelled device,’ first used for fireworks, dates back to the early 20th century. The verb, which originally meant ‘to attack with rockets,’ dates back to the late 18th century, and comes from the noun. The sense ‘to spring like a rocket’ was first used in the mid-19th century. Rocket, the noun meaning ‘a leafy green plant used in salads,’ is a bit older; it dates back to around the year 1500. It came into English from the Middle French noun roquette, which was in turn borrowed from the Italian rochetta, diminutive for ruca (a type of cabbage). It can be traced back to the Latin eruca (colewort), which is related to ericus (‘hedgehog’ or ‘beam with spikes’) and the Proto-Indo-European root ghers– (to bristle). Rocket, in this sense, is related to the Sanskrit harsate (bristles), the Avestan zarshayamna– (ruffling your feathers) and the Welsh garw (rough), as well as the English arugula and many other modern terms for the plant, and the English word horror.
